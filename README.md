## Executive Summary

MERIDIAN is a production MLOps platform that replaces manual heuristics with real-time, ML-driven asset management across a global hospitality portfolio. Eight model families — demand forecasting, reinforcement-learning dynamic pricing, ESG anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, NLP ticket routing, and more — run on one shared data and serving backbone, translating model metrics directly into financial statements:

- **+$4.8M annualized profit** from a +4.2% global RevPAR lift (forecast MAPE compressed 12.5% → 4.5%)
- **−$1.8M annual utility OpEx** from LSTM-driven leak detection and HVAC load shifting (−14% utility waste)
- **+$1.5M CapEx deferred** by predicting equipment failure 14 days ahead (−42% catastrophic downtime)
- **−$240k/year cloud spend** by consolidating 100+ models onto a dynamically batched GPU cluster (−58% hosting cost)
- **85% reduction in manual model-maintenance hours** via fully automated drift-triggered retraining

## GPU Serving Economics — The TCO Story

The serving layer is where model architecture becomes a cloud bill. Consolidating 100+ single-tenant CPU pods (idle ~95% of the time) onto a shared, dynamically batched Triton / EKS GPU cluster is the platform's clearest FinOps win:

![GPU FinOps serving economics — a single-tenant CPU fleet consolidated onto a shared, dynamically batched GPU cluster cuts hosting cost 58% while holding a sub-150ms p99 SLA](docs/assets/gpu-finops-tco.svg)

| Lever | Before — single-tenant CPU | After — shared batched GPU |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | 1 CPU instance per property model | 100+ models on one T4 cluster |
| Compute utilization | ~5% (idle, bursty traffic) | **80%+** (dynamic batching) |
| Scaling cost curve | linear with property count | sub-linear — decoupled from tenant count |
| Peak headroom | over-provisioned for peak | absorbs **10×** volume spikes |
| p99 inference latency | n/a | **< 150 ms** held under load |
| **Hosting cost** | baseline | **−58% (≈ −$240K/yr)** |

Dynamic batching buffers bursty, low-QPS requests (≤ 10 ms) into dense GPU work, so **unit cost per inference falls while throughput headroom rises** — the FinOps win and the SLA win are the same architectural move. Multi-model concurrency loads and unloads property-specific models in shared GPU memory, which is what decouples property scaling from linear infrastructure cost.

Serving configuration: [`serving/`](serving/) — Triton dynamic-batching config and EKS deployment manifest. The value-based selling case built on these economics lives in the [value-engineering playbook](https://github.com/daetan999/technical_resume/blob/main/docs/value-engineering.md).

## Spotlight: The RL Dynamic Pricing Agent

The flagship model is a **Deep Q-Network (PyTorch)** trained with ε-greedy exploration over offline historical simulation:

- **State space `S`** — inventory velocity (On-The-Book vs capacity), Days-To-Arrival window, hourly competitor pricing delta, and TFT demand quantiles (τ ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 0.9})
- **Action space `A`** — continuous rate modifications constrained to a **bounded action space** (−15% … +35% of baseline rack rate) to prevent race-to-the-bottom feedback loops with competitor pricing algorithms
- **Reward `R`** — maximizes yield over a rolling 30-day booking window: `R = Σ (Occupancy × ADR) − Penalty(overprice-vacancy)`
- **Hard SLA** — evaluate state and return a pricing action in **< 150 ms p99**; stale prices cause booking drop-offs on external channels

## Engineered Feature Families

| Feature family | Grain | Contents | Computed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `F_Demand_Lag` | room class × property | Rolling ADR & occupancy at t−1/7/14/30 · OTB booking velocity (first derivative) | Spark SQL window functions over 90-day partitions |
| `F_Climate_Index` | property location | Cooling / Heating Degree Days vs 18 °C base | Python microservice over weather APIs |
| `F_Telemetry_Spectral` | HVAC asset | FFT magnitude bands, peak frequencies, kurtosis from raw vibration | NumPy at the edge → Kafka |

Feature definitions: [`feature_store/feature_definitions.py`](feature_store/feature_definitions.py)

## Reliability Engineering

**Service-level objectives**

| SLO | Target |
|---|---|
| Pricing endpoint inference latency | p99 < 150 ms |
| Feature freshness (PMS event → Redis) | < 5 min |
| Daily ETL ingestion success | > 99.9% |

**Hardened edge cases**

- **Smart-meter null-value drops** — ingestion rejects null telemetry sequences and substitutes rolling-median inputs, preventing LSTM autoencoder crashes on sensor packet loss.
- **Cold-start properties** — new acquisitions with no booking history are t-SNE-mapped to their nearest existing property cluster and bootstrapped from that cluster's pre-trained TFT weights (transfer learning), giving day-one pricing accuracy and cutting onboarding from **3 weeks to 1 hour**.
- **Drift response tiers** — feature drift (Wasserstein > 0.15) warns; target drift (PSI > 0.20) auto-retrains; concept drift (Page-Hinkley > 3σ) pauses automated pricing and pages a human.
